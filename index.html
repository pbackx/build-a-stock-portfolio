    <p>
    	When you search the Internet for investment advice, you usually get two solutions:
    	<ul>
    		<li>"Buy one or more low cost ETFs."</li>
    		<li>"Buy stock in this very special company I selected for you."</li>
    	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Neither of those are bad, but they come with drawbacks:
		<ul>
			<li>ETFs will follow the market, so you'll never get more returns than the market.</li>
			<li>Individual stocks can beat the market by a large margin. However, what if you picked the wrong company?</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
    <p>
    	What if there was a third option? One that has <strong>a good chance of beating the markt, but with less risk than buying stock?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    	There is! <strong>Use a formula to automatically select a range of stock that fit your style and choices and create your own fund.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    	Every month, Build-a-Stock-Portfolio presents a formula and selects a 10 stock portfolio. One that we will revisit next year to see how it performed.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>You can use the portfolio's straight away, or, even better, use the tips and howto's to create your own portfolio.</strong>

    <div class="who">
      <h2 style="text-align: start;">Hi, I'm Peter</h2>
      <p>I'm a freelance software engineer by day and an investor by night.</p>
      <p>Over the years, I've tried a lot of approaches, but I keep coming back to the scientific method. Trying out things and seeing how they work out.</p>
      <p>I don't believe in short term profits, so I don't do daytrades or quick wins. Since I do this at night, I couldn't even if I wanted.</p>
      <p>I could tell you I have been doing this since 2013 with 10% yearly profit. But honestly, I don't know. This is one of the reasons I'm doing this. I want to keep a track record from now on.</p>
