When I started thinking about this portfolio idea, October 31st was going to be the absolute, for-sure, set-in-stone date for Brexit. Great Britain would be leaving the European Union, no matter what.

It looks like it will be yet another symbolic date with not much actual change happening, however, one things is fore sure: Brexit is happening and it will impact companies.

So this month, I'm taking a look at the companies on the London Stock Exchange.

## Brexit

It's widely believed that a [Brexit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit), deal or no-deal, will have a negative impact on British companies.

One could argue that this is already calculated into the value of many companies.

However, what if it turns out Brexit is not as bad as people think? Wouldn't it be interesting to investigate the most oversold British companies at the moment and see if they may be better of than expected.

## RSI

[The RSI or Relative Strength Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) is a number ranging from 0 to 100 that indicates how much the price of a stock has recently changed:

* **Below 30**: The stock has been oversold and may be undervalued.
* **Above 70**: The may be overvalued.

It is a technical indicator for the momentum, which means how much the stock has been moving up or down lately.

Another indicator that you may want to look into is the [Moving Average Convergence Divergence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp).

## This Month's Portfolio

This month's criteria is looking for the biggest companies on the London Stock exchange that are oversold:

- RSI below 30.
- London Stock Exchange only.
- Largest enterprise value first.

Note that limiting to the London Stock Exchange does not guarantee these are British companies. I'm going to leave these in, because it's hard to create good criteria of when a company is really British or not.
