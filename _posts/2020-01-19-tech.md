This month, I'm going to look at my favorite sector, namely high-tech companies. I love them so much, I'm going to give you two portfolio's. One that's picked by an algorithm and one I handpicked myself. 

Picking stock myself? It's crazy, but I'm still looking forward to the result.

## Stock picking

As you may have read on [the landing page](https://www.buildastockportfolio.com/) of this site and from various footnotes, I'm not a fan of [picking individual stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/09/can-fund-managers-pick-stocks.asp) at all. It's an interesting hobby, but it's extremely difficult to truly understand a company, let alone study multiple companies and make a proper comparison and selection.

On this site, I think the real deal is to use some kind of repeatable algorithm and select a small portfolio of companies to invest in.

Yet, every investor thinks he has an edge and knows how to pick the right companies. I think so too! In this case, I've worked in various tech companies for the last 20 years and I have followed tech from close by. So I'm feeling overconfident and think this may be a the one portfolio where I can do better.

Let's see if I can prove myself wrong.

## This Month's Personal Choices

So here's my personal list in no particular order. I have added a column to write down why I like the company so I'm able to make a better evaluation next year.

| Symbol | Name            | Current Price | Reason I Picked It                                           |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| NVDA   | Nvidia          | $245.57       | They keep making the best and most popular graphical cards and finding more and more applications for them. |
| MTLS   | Materialise     | $19.01        | 3D printing is bound to go big soon. This is one of the smaller players in the niche. They focus on software and just pick whoever will be the hardware winner. |
| ESTC   | Elastic         | $71.51        | Every site, every company needs to search their stuff, whatever it is. Many don't want to hand over all their data to Google. Elastic is their best option. |
| AKA    | Akka            | €67.40        | They have a very strong portfolio of solid "platform" software. Let's see if they can sell it. |
| PRX    | Prosus          | €70.80        | Naspers wanted to make it easier for you to invest in them, so here you have it. Invest together with them into a very diversified tech portfolio. |
| NTDOY  | Nintendo        | $49.01        | Unlike Xbox and Playstation, Nintendo's Switch appeals to a much broader audience. In spite of smaller budgets, they keep out-innovating the others (eg Nintento Labo) |
| TCEHY  | Tencent         | $51.17        | Another mega-company that's diversified all over the place. And on top of that, they are the best way for you to invest in the success of Fortnite. I know Prosus is a large shareholder of Tencent, so I may regret that I picked them both. |
| SHOP   | Shopify         | $448.51       | Their no-nonsense, easy to use, e-shopping platform keeps appearing on more and more sites. Bright future ahead. |
| ZG     | Zillow          | $46.51        | This is a candidate for turnaround of the year. Zillow is lightyears ahead of most other real estate sites. They haven't been doing stellar lately, but I'm expecting a rebound any moment now. |
| SPCE   | Virgin Galactic | $14.68        | This is my moonshot pick. If they manage to pull of space travel, their stock price is going to rocket straight into space. |



## This Month's Portfolio

And now for the real portfolio. I'm keeping it really simple this time:

There are a lot of unknown (to me) companies in there. This may be a good thing or a bad thing. Let's wait and see.
