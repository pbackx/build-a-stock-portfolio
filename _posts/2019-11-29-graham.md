This time, I want to go back to the basics. I'm taking a look at Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing. I will limit my search to the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Probably some of the best known stock exchanges and the easiest to access for most people in the world.

## The Graham Number

Benjamin Graham has written what many people would call the foundational book on value investing: **The Intelligent Investor**.

As you can see from this very short summary, Benjamin Graham had a lot of theories and ideas to value stock. Throughout his life, these ideas have changed, but this month, I want to highlight the **"Graham number"**.

The idea of the [Graham number](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/graham-number.asp) is to measure a company's fundamental value. It's a deceptively simple calculation, so it has its limitations. 

The number takes into account two numbers:

* **Earnings per share**: How much profit does the company have per outstanding share. The higher, the better.
* **Book value per share**: If the company would have to be sold or liquidated right now, what would it be worth? If it is higher than 1, it means you are getting a discount. You are paying $1 for assets worth more than $1. So again, in general, the higher this number, the better.

The number ignores many qualitative factors that you may also want to look into when value investing:

* Management
* Value of patents or the company's brand
* Competitive advantage

But sometimes simplicity can be a good thing and overcomplicating things with subjective qualitative analysis can lead to bad decisions.

Since Graham has a lot of interesting thoughts on selecting companies of high value, I may return to his writings in later months.

## This Month's Portfolio

This month's criteria is looking for companies that provide the most value for the buck:

- Order by price / Graham number, lowest first.
- Companies on the NYSE or NASDAQ.
- Excluding financial companies, just because.
- Enterprise value over 250 million.
