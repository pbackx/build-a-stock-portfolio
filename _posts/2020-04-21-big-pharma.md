This month, I'm continuing my search for stock that may benefit the current situation and will also do good in the long run, regardless of what happens.

## Pharmaceuticals

What's not to like about pharmaceutical companies in a world where more people are sick than ever, and we're counting on drugs to give us back our freedom.

Although pharmaceuticals may sound like a sure bet, keep in mind:

- Researching a new drug takes ages.
- Researching a new drug takes tons of money.
- Researching a new drug is incredibly risky as there's no guarantee it will work.
- Patents on drugs don't last. So companies need to be continuously looking for new drugs.

That said, there is one big certainty. People are counting on drugs to help them. Especially as more and more people get older and older, you can be sure of one thing, people will keep buying drugs. Not just during the Corona crisis.

A good way to mitigate the risk and enjoy the benefits is to diversify. And that's exactly what we do around here.

## Large Cap

I've previously written about [biotech companies](https://www.buildastockportfolio.com/biotech.html). For that portfolio, I was looking for big risk in return for potential big rewards.

This time, I'm taking the opposite approach. I want big companies with lots of money (and thus also proven track records).

I'm talking about [large cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp).

And as last month, I'm also taking into account the debt ratio and the cash on hand combined with short term investments.

## This Month's Portfolio

These are the rules for the portfolio:

- Europe and USA pharma companies.
- Debt-to-equity ratio below 100%.
- Enterprise value over $10 billion.
- As much cash and short term investments as possible.

|AZN|AstraZeneca PLC|50.44 USD|6.18B USD|145.49B USD|76.22%|


A lot of big names in there, so that should at least give us some stability. And according to [Uncle Stock](http://www.unclestock.com/?referrer=5693737131835392)'s backtesting, we can expect a 10% yearly return.
