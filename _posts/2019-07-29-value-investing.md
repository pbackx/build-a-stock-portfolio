[I recently read "God dobbelt niet op de beurs"](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2857651154?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1). The book is only available in Dutch (for now?) and I can't give you a good English book that covers similar ground, but I can share some of the lessons I learned.

First and foremost, historically speaking, you should absolutely not invest in actively managed funds. This may be common knowledge, but it's good to reiterate. Study after study shows that, on average, mutual funds underperform the market. If you don't want to actively manage your portfolio yourself, your best bet is to buy an ETF that tracks an index of your choice.

Second, retail investors are very unlikely to beat the market, mostly because they don't have a system (called "investment style" in the book). And because they don't have a system they tend to buy and sell at the worst possible moments.

That's what this site is all about: Finding a proper system.

## Factors

The book goes on to mention that one investment style that, over longer periods, has consistently beaten the market is [factor investing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factor-investing.asp).

It's an investment system that takes one specific quality of stocks and focuses on it. For instance, a typical factor that has been shown to outperform the market is "high and growing dividend". In general, if you create a portfolio that consists of stock that pays a high dividend and has historically increased the dividend, you will outperform the market over long enough time stretches.

Other popular factors include:

* **Value**: These are companies that are good companies, but for some reason, the market has underpriced them and you can buy them cheaply.
* **Momentum**: If a stock price is rising, it will usually keep rising. And the other way around.
* **Small caps**: Small companies tend to outperform larger companies.

## Value

This month, I will focus on the "value" factor. 

If you look around, there are many ways to identify value stock and you should most certainly do your own research and think about everything that is proposed.

You will [encounter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuestock.asp) the following ratio's [a lot](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/295673/how-to-screen-for-classic-value-stocks):

- **P/E or price-earnings ratio**: The lower this is, the more this company is earning and the more earnings you'll get for the same price.
- **P/B or price to book value**: The book value is what value you'd get if you liquidated all the company's assets right now. As in the previous ratio, the lower this is, the cheaper you can buy the company. 

## This Month's Portfolio

With that in mind, here are the criteria for this month's selection:

- I'm choosing the traditional *European and US markets*.
- Sort by P/E, lowest first.
- P/B under 2.
- A mid cap company, which means an enterprise value between 2 and 10 billion.

A backtest of this criteria is not very promising (I ran my backtest using [Uncle Stock](http://www.unclestock.com/?referrer=5693737131835392)). There are some very good years, but the bad years tend to be so bad it doesn't matter. Potentially, a good stop loss could help here?
