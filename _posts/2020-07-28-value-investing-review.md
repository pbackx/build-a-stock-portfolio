One year after selecting a number of undervalued companies, it's time to look back. Is this a strategy worth pursuing?

## The Results

{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}

| Symbol | Name | Percentage |
| :-- | :-- | --: |
| SDLPF | Seadrill Partners LLC | -82.1% |
| VVPS.VI | Volksbank Vorarlberg e. Gen. | -45.45% |
| SWN | Southwestern Energy Co. | 27.75% |
| XIN | Xinyuan Real Estate Co. Ltd. | -43.48% |
| GPOR | Gulfport Energy Corp. | -66.77% |
| CRZO | Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. | -76.19% |
| DNR | Denbury Resources, Inc. | -77.67% |
| IRS | IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones SA | -58.76% |
| AR | Antero Resources Corp. | -30.94% |
| RZA | Reinsurance Group of America, Inc. | -4.3% |
|  | **Total** | -45.791% |

I think it would be an understatement to say that the portfolio did not do well. It wasn't a good year for shares in general, but many have already recovered from their March/April crash. Some of the shares in the portfolio did recover, but they were already on a downward trend. 

In hindsight, I already predicted that a backtest of this selection criteria was not very promising.

Note that **Carrizo Oil & Gas** merged with **Callon** (CPE). Shareholders received 1.75 shares CPE in return for one share CRZO.

## Value

In spite of the performance, I'm choosing to believe in [value investing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp) for one more year. 

I'm also sticking with the same ratios:

- **P/E or price-earnings ratio**: The lower this is, the more this company is earning and the more earnings you'll get for the same price.
- **P/B or price to book value**: The book value is what value you'd get if you liquidated all the company's assets right now. As in the previous ratio, the lower this is, the cheaper you can buy the company. 

## This Month's Portfolio

With that in mind, here are the criteria for this month's selection:

- I'm using [the Finviz screener](https://www.finviz.com/screener.ashx), which means all companies are on the major US exchanges.
- Sort by P/E, lowest first.
- P/B under 1.
- I double checked the numbers via [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/s/b621e7de ) and sampled various other investing sites, because some of the Finviz data did not appear to be reliable.

There are some [penny stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennystock.asp) in there, which means there's significant risk. We'll see next year.
