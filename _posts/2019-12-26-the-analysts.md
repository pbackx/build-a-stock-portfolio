For the last portfolio of the year, I'm going to look at the analysts that are now publishing their "top stocks to watch in 2020". The selection criteria is a bit different than usual. But I think it's going to be interesting to validate whether or not trusting all those analysis's and forecasts makes any sense.

## Predictions

It's famously known that predicting the stock market is a fool's errand. Every one is advised to avoid predicting, yet every one is doing it.

Many financial publications live by a constant stream of analyst forecasts. It looks like it's an easy way to get eyeballs. Even though studies show there isn't a single person that can consistently predict the market. It's almost impossible to tell what companies are going to be a good short term investments.

But what if there is wisdom in the crowds? What if you could combine all predictions and extract an "über-prediction" of what is going to happen? Let's try it out with a few popular sites.

I've picked 5 of the bigger sites and their tips for next year:

* [Fortune](https://fortune.com/longform/best-stocks-2020-investing-advice-experts/) interviews 5 experts. In total, they recommend 13 shares: Aspen Technology (AZPN), Autodesk (ADSK), Danaher (DHR), Disney (DIS), General Electric (GE), Intuit (INTU), MercadoLibre (MELI), Prudential Financial (PRU), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), Union Pacific (UNP), United Airlines (UAL), United Parcel Service (UPS), and Walmart (WMT).
* [On CNBC, Michael Farr](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/20/michael-farrs-top-10-stock-picks-for-2020.html) tips the following stock: Disney (DIS), FedEx (FDX), Valmont Industries (VMI), Lowe’s Cos (LOW), Becton, Dickinson & Co (BDX), CVS Health (CVS), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft Corp (MSFT), Chevron (CVX), and Truist Financial Corp (TFC).
* [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-10-best-stocks-for-2020-51576285200) 10 picks are: Alphabet (GOOGL), Amerco (UHAL), Anthem (ANTM), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK), Comcast (CMCSA), Dell Technologies (DELL), Pfizer (PFE), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS/B), United Technologies (UTX), and ViacomCBS (VIAC).
* [Kiplinger](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/T052-S001-the-20-best-stocks-to-buy-for-2020/index.html) has 20 suggestions: AstraZeneca (AZN), Bright Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM), Chemours (CC), Copart (CPRT), Costco (COST), CVS Health (CVS), Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO), Disney (DIS), Energy Transfer LP (ET), Linde (LIN), McDonald's (MCD), Medtronic (MDT), Motorola Solutions (MSI), Nvidia (NVDA), Okta Inc. (OKTA), Shell Midstream Partners LP (SHLX), SPDR Gold MiniShares (GLDM), Trip.com Group (TCOM), U.S. Bancorp (USB), and VISA (V).
* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/companies-to-watch-2020/) has 50 companies to watch. To keep the numbers comparable to the other's above, I sorted them by earnings per share growth and took the first 20: CD Projekt (OTGLY), American International Group (AIG), Netflix (NFLX), Nidec (NJDCY), Tullow (TUWOY), AIA (AAGIY), Anta Sports (ANPDY), Siemens (SIEGY), Facebook (FB), Toyota (TM), Lululemon (LULU), Just Eat (JSTTY), Global Payments (GPN), Schlumberger (SLB), T-Mobile (TMUS), Motorola Solutions (MSI), MPLX (MPLX), Goodman Group (GMGSF), Keyence (KYCCF), and Bayer (BAYN.DE)

## This Month's Portfolio

This month's criteria is looking for companies that the analysts picked:

- First I took all the companies that were picked by more than one analyst: CVS, DIS and MSI.
- All the other companies, I ordered by estimated EPS for next year and took the top 7.

| :-------| :-------------------------------|--------------:|------------------------:|
| GOOGL  | Alphabet Inc.                  | 1,347.82      | 54.13                   |
| ANTM   | Anthem, Inc.                   | 304.33        | 22.71                   |
| UHAL   | AMERCO                         | 372.43        | 21.72                   |

| TMO    | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.  | 325.72        | 13.60                   |
| UAL    | United Airlines Holdings, Inc. | 89.39         | 12.80                   |
| FDX    | FedEx Corporation              | 151.01        | 12.49                   |
| MSI    | Motorola Solutions, Inc.       | 162.13        | 8.57                    |
| CVS    | CVS Health Corporation         | 74.59         | 7.14                    |
| DIS    | The Walt Disney Company        | 145.61        | 6.22                    |

You'll notice that the 3 companies that were picked by multiple analysts have the lowest EPS of the group, so this may impact how they perform. Let's evaluate next year if this was a good way of working.
